# Pedro News
I'm writing a bi-weekly journal to keep Ed updated on my life.

Each periodical, a new (slash, the same) guest will submit some interesting tid bits from their lives

_27/09/2016_

### TL; DR

I am having phsyio.

I went to Oktoberfest "Prost!" 🍻

My brother got married. 🎩

I saw a good film.

## Physio

I had physio on my ankle. They are making me do exercises while I brush my teeth.

## Oktoberfest

The following friends of mine went to Oktoberfest! This is in no particular order.

* Pedro
* Al
* Kate
* Luke
* Kirsten
* Omar
* Sara
* Milky Joe
* Stinky

It was very fun. We drank a lot of beer - but thanks to German Brewing Legislation, which prevent originality in Beer production, the drinking didn't trouble us with the hangovers we deserved.

During the trip, we found out that Al is actually a bee 🐝. This was based on irrefutable evidence, such as his love of honey 🍯 (he likely produces his own), and his debilitating fear of the bee's mortal enemy, the wasp.

We also heard the following words spoken by the wisest man in the land.

>You can eat all you want, but you can't UN-eat.

>\- Christopher Ruffle

We still do not truly understand what he meant.

## Marriage

My Brother, Robin, and his (now) wife, Rebecca, had their nuptials. It was a magical affair. I got to wear tails and a cravat, but unfortunately, no top hat. I learned firsthand that cravats are basically rubbish long ties.

All four of my siblings had a part to play in the wedding. Michael, my eldest brother, made a short film celebrating a wedding day. He quite expertly interwove narratives from a variety of different films.

Emma, my sister, wrote a poem, and performed it during the ceremony. It was both moving and amusing.

Even Robin had a part to play, as the Groom.

I was asked to get everyone on and off the coaches, a duty which I took very seriously. In my humble opinion, my performance in the task really made the day special.

The newly-weds have now gone to the Lake District for a mini-moon.

## A Good Film

I also saw a good film. I couldn't recommend it more. It's called, Hunt for the Wilderpeople.
