# Pedro News
I'm writing a bi-weekly journal to keep Ed updated on my life.

Each periodical, a new (slash, the same) guest will submit some interesting tid bits from their lives

# SPECIAL EDITION

This weeks Pedro News will be a celebration of music, as I list my 30 favourite albums of all time. It won't be easy, but I will make it if I try.

In no particular order (I say that, but the albums I like the most will probably be nearer the top than the bottom).

<!-- 1 -->

### Paul Simon: Graceland

I first heard Graceland when I was 8 years old, and I assumed it was brand new. It was only a decade later, when I bought it for myself, that I found out it was released in 1986! It is without a doubt a timeless classic, and one I come back to again and again.

### Bon Iver: Bon Iver

Bon Iver's second studio album (SPOILER ALERT: his first also appears in this list), is the more mature, synthy outing - and it's absolutely fantastic start to finish. I'm also slightly biased, as seeing him perform this album at Hammersmith Apollo was the best musical experience of my young life.

![Weekend in the City](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8c/A_Weekend_in_the_City.jpg)

### Bloc Party: Weekend in the City

The album that reminds me most of Uni - not a song on there that I didn't absolutely love at the time, and most of it still holds up today.

<!-- 4 -->

![Room on Fire](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9f/Room_on_Fire_cover.jpg)

### The Strokes: Room on Fire

The Strokes best work, and their most Strokes-y; simple, catchy, quality indie tunes.

<!-- 5 -->

![Wincing the Night Away](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7f/Wincing_the_Night_Away.jpg)

### The Shins: Wincing the Night Away

I'll warn you now, this won't be the only Shins entry in this list. But this is probably their best work.

<!-- 6 -->

![Illinois](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/01/Sufjan_Stevens_-_Illinois.jpg)

### Sufjan Stevens: Illinois

I've always found Sufjan to be slightly hit and miss, but his hits are uplifting, orchestral, moving, and quite frankly unparalleled. Out of all his studio albums Illinois probably has the best hits-to-misses ratio.

<!-- 7 -->

![XX](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Xx_album_cover.svg)

### The XX: XX

Another band that remind me of Uni - The XX's first album still remains their best (although I did really like Coexist). Minimalist indie fare at it's finest.

<!-- 8 -->

![Channel Orange](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/28/Channel_ORANGE.jpg)

### Frank Ocean: Channel Orange

Frank Ocean is excellent at producing catchy, pop/hip-hop songs, but he elevates them with unusual, genre defying lyrics. His second album Blonde is decent too.

<!-- 9 -->

![Sigur Ros](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/92/%C3%81g%C3%A6tisByrjunCover.JPG)

### Sigur Ros: Ágætis Byrjun

A favourite of 16 year old me at St Bede's; no I don't understand a single word on the album (it's in Icelandic) - does that matter? Not a bit.

<!-- 10 -->

![For Emma, Forever Ago](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e0/Bon_iver_album_cover.jpg)

### Bon Iver: For Emma, Forever Ago

Bon Iver's first album doesn't match the highs of the second - but it's too good not to secure a mention.
