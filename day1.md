# Pedro News
I'm writing a bi-weekly journal to keep Ed updated on my life.

### TL; DR

I got injured at football.

It was Adam's 30th Birthday.

I made a big lasagne.

### Injury

I played football on both Friday (where I had a spat with an angry midget footballer), and Saturday. This proved to be too much football for my poor little legs. I twisted my ankle with the last kick of the game, and am now hobbling around with a swollen ankle. I believe I will be out of action (OOA) for at least 3 months, so I might seek physio.

### Adam

My good friend Adam had his 30th Birthday party and it was a rather fun shindig. We went to his, and bbq'd, then to Boogs, and boogied.

### Lasagne

Becky and I arose the next day quite hungover. A lasagne will cure this! I exclaimed. We went and bought a new pair of Nike's, and purchased the raw ingredients for a tasty Italian meal. I slow cooked the ragu for several hours, before making a decadent white sauce. Becky layered the resulting components into a deep ceramic dish with some thin layers of pasta (sometimes referred to as pasta sheets), and covered it with a generous helping of grated cheese. We then placed it in the oven on approximately 160 degrees celsius (with fan setting on), for 20-25 minutes. It was not bad.
